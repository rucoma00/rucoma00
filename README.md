    <summary><h3>🚀 Rubén's Journey </h3></summary>
        I started my professional career working for a robotics start-up which provided me with a lot of useful experience in the field of R+D. However, I decided to make a big change in my life and joined a multinational company to expand and explore my passion for coding. I finished my studies in Electronic Engineering in late 2022. During that time, I tried to make the most out of every course, which helped me discover  my passion about prototyping and designing new devices capable of solving engineering problems. I also challenged myself by taking part in many university entrepeneur programs and contests archieving great succes in some of them. I try to stay constantly learning new skills and espanding my knowledge in all the different engineering disciplines.
