    <summary><h3>🚀 Rubén's Journey </h3></summary>
        I finished my studies in Electronic Engineering in late 2022. During that time, I tried to make the most out of every course, which helped me discover  my passion about prototyping and designing new devices capable of solving engineering problems. I also challenged myself by taking part in many university entrepeneur programs and contests archieving great succes in some of them. I try to stay constantly learning new skills and espanding my knowledge in all the different engineering disciplines.
